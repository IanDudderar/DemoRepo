Hello everyone, my name is Cormac Conahan. I am a computer science major here at the College of Charleston and have 3 semesters left to enjoy. I was born in Texas but I moved to South Carolina almost before I can remember. I love rock climbing, surfing, hiking, and basically all things outdoors. I am looking forward to working with you all!
