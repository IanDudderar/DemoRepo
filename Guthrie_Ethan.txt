My name is Ethan, and, at the time of posting this, I am a third-year student at the College of Charleston. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science (hence this blog), Psychology, and Spanish.
I currently work at the College of Charleston as a Student Network Engineer. Before that I worked for three years at a veterinary clinic in North Charleston called 
Lowcountry Pet Wellness Clinic.

Despite my busy schedule, I still find time for some hobbies when exams aren't in season: running, playing video games, playing board games (if I can convince anyone to play with me),
and hanging out with my family. I am a triplet (one brother, one sister) so I've always had companions growing up (but they still won't play board games with me).
