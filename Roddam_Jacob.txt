My name is Jacob Roddam and I am a senior Computer Science student at the College of Charleston. I was born in the Bay Area of California, but have lived most of my life in the Charleston area. In my personal time I love to play and watch basketball, play guitar, listen to music, and watch TV. Over the summer my girlfriend and I adopted a three-legged dog named Kuzco, and he is indeed man's best friend. After I graduate I hope to have a career in software development and see where that takes me!
